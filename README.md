This is an assembler made as a part of a course I took @ [The Open University of Israel](https://www.openu.ac.il/).

To compile, you can simply run `make`. This will generate an executable, `Assembler`, and to check it, just run

```bash
./Assembler <filepath>
```

For your comfort, in the /Tests folder I have included examples of both valid and invalid files to check my Assembler. 

This project isn't maintained anymore, but if you want, feel free to sumbit a pull request with the modifications and an explanations for your work, I might poke at it.
